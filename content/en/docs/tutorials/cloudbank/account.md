## Using Cloudbank

1. **WARNING**: ANY USE OF CLOUDBANK MUST INCLUDE THAT YOU HAVE A DEEP
   UNDERSTANDING HOW CHARGES ARE DONE. WASTEFUL USE OF RESOURCES WHICH
   COST REAL $ WILL RESULT IN AN IMMEDIATE TERMINATION OF YOUR
   ACCOUNT. Any cost above $100 over the semester must be preapproved
   and accompanied by a detailed cost breakdown.
2. Students need to create an account on https://cloudbank.org with
   their university e-mail. Please follow the instructions.
3. If multiple students need an account all students must have completed step 1 before we proceed.
4. All names and emails as entered in Cloudbank must be forwarded to Gregor and Bud.

## Activating your Cloudbank account with our project

4. Gregor will activate your Cloudbank account in the Cloudbank
   project. You do not have to do anything but wait. Gregor will
   notify Bud.
5. Bud will add you to AWS via Cloudbank. He will try to limit your
   spending amount to $100 initially. You do not have to do 
   anything but wait.
6. Bud will notify you and Gregor once this is done.
7. This process is done on best effort and as we have never done it it
   may take some time to complete. We anticipate a week.

## What to do while you wait

8. Find out which services you need on AWS
9. Find out what they cost as we have to pay for it in $ this needs to
   be estimated precisely
10. If it exceeds $100 you need to figure out why and estimate the total
    cost over the entire semester as we do not have unlimited funds.
11. Make sure you understand running costs and startup costs for a
    service. Note: starting a service every second will cost a lot!
12. Learn that you must not place keys and certs in your
    gitrepos. Figure out where to place them
13. If you need ssh and use Windows use gitbash.
14. Improve this tutorial and make pull pull request with your improvement.

## Pitfalls

1. Ignore reading the documentation
2. Not understanding ssh kegen, ssh agent, ssh-add
3. On Windows: Juts using putty and not understanding gitbash
4. Placeing any key in your project code other then reading them from a secure filesystem.
5. Not understanding what 1-4 is about.

## Alternatives

1. Try to use alternatives whenever you can
2. Spark is available on [Rivanna](https://www.rc.virginia.edu/userinfo/rivanna/software/spark/)
3. Hadoop development can be done on Windows, Mac, Linux (Search in
   google how to set it up). Development is often easier on your
   laptop. Once you complete it use cloudbank.
4. MPI is available on Rivanna
5. TF and pytorch is available on Rivanna
6. Jupyter notebooks can be run on Rivanna or Google Collab
