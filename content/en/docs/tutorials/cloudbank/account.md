**WARNING**: ANY USE OF CLOUDBANK MUST INCLUDE THAT YOU HAVE A DEEP
UNDEARSTANDING HOW CHARGES ARE DONE. WASTFUL USE OF RESOURCES WHICH
COST REAL $ WILL RESULT IN AN IMMEDIATE TERMINATION OF YOUR
ACCOUNT. Any cost above $100 over the semester must be preaproved and
accompanied with a detailed cost break down. 

## Using Cloudbank

1. Students need to create an account on https://cloudbank.org with
   their university e-mail. Please follow the instructions
2. If multiple studnets need an account all students that need a
   cloudaccount must have completed step 1 before we proceed.
   If that deadline set by your teacher is missed, you will have to
   likely wait. 
3. Once all students have applied we will do the next step.

## Activating your cloudbank account with our project

4. Gregor will activate your cloudbank account in the cloudbank
   project. You do not have to do anything but wait. Gregor will
   notify Bud.
5. Bud will add you to AWS via cloudbank. He will try to limit your
   spending amount to $100 initially. You do not have to do 
   anything but wait.
6. Bud will notify you and Gregor once this is done.
7. This process is done n best effort and as we have never done it it
   may take some time to complete. We anticipate a week.

## What to do while you wait

8. Find out which services you need on AWS
9. Find out what they cost as we have to pay for it in $ this needs to
   be estimated precisely
10. If it exceeds $100 you need to figure out why and estimate total
    cost over the entire semester as we do not have unlimited funds.
11. Make sure you understand running costs and startup costs for a
    service. Note: starting a service every second will cost a lot!
12. learn that you must not palce keys and certs in your
    gitrepos. Figure out where to place them
13. If you neeed ssh and use windows use gitbash.
