Over its first two hundred years, the University of Virginia has been at
the forefront of producing global citizen leaders, groundbreaking
research and scholarship, and world-class patient care. As the
University enters its third century, we continuously seek to define and
redefine ourselves, motivated by our shared passion for discovery,
innovation, community, service, and social justice. One of the
University's top priorities is to create a living, learning, and work
environment that supports---and challenges---our academic community. To
achieve its mission, the University must be a place in which all
faculty, students, and staff are active participants in its work, where
those groups historically excluded from participation in University life
are present in numbers that prevent isolation of the spirit and of the
mind, and where each individual is conscious of how they contribute to
the creation and dissemination of knowledge that enhances the well-being
of our community, our state, our nation, and the world.

Listed below are specific details about how the University of Virginia
(UVA) is engaging in a meaningful way with respect to DEI, as well as
the project plans to ensure that historically underrepresented groups
are a collaborative part of our project.

## Inclusion of persons from groups underrepresented in STEM as PI, co-PI, and/or senior personnel

-   UVA seeks to hire persons from underrepresented groups and will seek
    representative applicants for the senior personnel in this effort.

-   The UVA's diversity action plan includes actions steps and metrics
    to provide training and support to create processes that mitigate
    bias and are more equitable and inclusive. In 2021, the University
    created an Inclusive Excellence Planning Committee to assess
    inclusivity, which suggested regular professional development
    opportunities to all provost office units (including the
    Biocomplexity Institute), and to offer leadership development
    opportunities around diversity, equity and inclusion. UVA has a goal
    of attracting and retaining greater numbers of individuals from
    underrepresented populations. UVA's Racial Equity Task Force (RETF)
    aligned initiatives with the University\'s Inclusive Excellence
    framework and the University\'s 2030 Strategic Plan to orient and
    embed the initiatives in the institutional operations.

-   Mentoring and support programs to increase retention include the
    Division for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion at the UVA, which
    provides outreach, resources, and support for inclusive hiring
    practices for departments and faculty.

## Inclusion of persons from groups underrepresented in STEM as student researchers or post-doctoral researchers

-   We will seek representative applicants for the postdoctoral position
    in this effort.

-   The Office of Diversity Programs at UVA cultivates a rich, inclusive
    and supportive learning environment, where the identities,
    perspectives, and views of all graduate students and postdoctoral
    scholars are affirmed to establish dignity and pride to thrive at
    the University of Virginia. The Office of Diversity Programs is a
    subsidiary of the Office of Graduate and Postdoctoral Affairs (OGPA)
    and serves as a resource hub for information to connect students,
    staff, and faculty to opportunities by offering recruitment and
    retention, developmental training, and community engagement and
    outreach programs.

## Enhancement/collaboration with existing diversity programs at your home organization and/or nearby organizations

The University of Virginia's Racial Equity Task Force (RETF) aligned initiatives with the University\'s Inclusive Excellence framework and the University\'s 2030 Strategic Plan to orient and embed the initiatives in the institutional operations. The Division for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion office at the University of Virginia offers training on education and prevention related to discrimination and harassment, sexual misconduct, mandated reporting. 

### University efforts located in or benefiting underserved communities.

-   The Center for Community Partnerships at University of Virginia
    serves as both a front door to the University for community members
    and a collaborative space for UVA's existing community efforts. The
    center is anchored by UVA's Equity Center, and is staffed by members
    of the University's offices for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion;
    Academic Outreach; and Community Partnerships at UVA Health.
