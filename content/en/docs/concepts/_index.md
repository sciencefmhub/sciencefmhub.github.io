## Foundation Model

Definition from Stanford:

> "any model that is trained on broad data (generally using
> self-supervision at scale) that can be adapted (e.g., fine-tuned) to
> a wide range of downstream tasks". <https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07258>

Answer from ChatGPT 3.5:

> "A foundation model typically refers to a pre-trained machine
> learning model that serves as the basis or starting point for more
> specialized or task-specific models. These models are trained on
> large and diverse datasets to learn general patterns and
> representations of the data. Once trained, they can be fine-tuned or
> adapted for specific tasks or domains with smaller, task-specific
> datasets.
>
> In the context of natural language processing (NLP), models like
> OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) can be considered
> foundation models. These models are trained on massive amounts of
> text data to understand the structure and relationships within
> language. Users can then fine-tune these models for specific tasks
> such as text classification, language translation, summarization,
> and more.
>
> The advantage of using foundation models lies in their ability to
> capture general knowledge and language understanding, which can be
> beneficial for a wide range of applications. Fine-tuning allows
> developers to leverage the pre-learned representations for specific
> tasks without the need to train a model from scratch, saving
> computational resources and time."
